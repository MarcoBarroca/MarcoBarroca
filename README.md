<h1>Hi, my name is Marco Antonio Barroca!</h1>
I'm a physicist from Rio de Janeiro, currently a Ph.D. Candidate @ CBPF. Recently I've been hired by IBM as a Reserach Intern.

<h3>Quantum Computers, Quantum Metrology and Quantum Algorithms</h3>

My research is focused on Quantum Information and recently I've been working on Quantum Chemistry simulations with Qiskit. I've done some work on Quantum Metrology and Topological Quantum Computers with anyons during my Masters but I've been less active on those areas as of right now.

<h3>Contributing</h3>

I try to help out with [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit). Specifically the [platypus](https://github.com/Qiskit/platypus) repo. I've been meaning to help out with [qiskit-nature](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature) as well.
